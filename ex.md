### Initializing a local repo

Whenever we start a new project from scratch or have an existing project and just want to turn it into a repository.

1. Navigate the command line to the folder you want initialized.
2. Initialize a new repo.
3. Create a new file.  
    You can use `echo Hello_World >> new_file.txt` to quickly create a new file.
4. Stage (add it to the index) and commit it.

### Cloning a repo

Whenever we have a remote repository that we'd like to have a copy of, and possibly start uploading changes to.
