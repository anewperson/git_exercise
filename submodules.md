Working with Submodules
=======================

### Adding a submodule to an existing repo

For whenever you wish to have another repo as a part of your repo.

1. Initialize a new local empty repo.

2. Add some files to it, just to create an initial commit.

3. Add a new submodule connected to the exercise repo in a subfolder named `exercise`.

4. Notice the new commit the new submodule changes. 

### Rewinding the submodule to a specific commit

### Initializing submodules in cloned repos

### Resynchronizing submodules
