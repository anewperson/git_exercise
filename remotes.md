Working with Remotes
--------------------

For this exercise you're going to need a repo with write permissions, so in case you have one use it.
If not, in the next paragraph I'll show you how to fork the one I created in GitHub so you could write to it.

### Forking a GitHub repo

1. Create an account in [GitHub](https://github.com/).

2. Browse to https://github.com/mastern2k3/git_exercise and fork my repo:

3. Now that you have your own repo, you can use the URL below to upload changes:

    ![Get the fork URL](fork_url.png)

    Should look something like this: `https://github.com/anewperson/git_exercise.git`.

4. That's it! Now you have your own copy and you are ready to push changes to it.

### Cloning a remote repo and committing changes

1. Clone your remote repository as you did in the branches, only now - **use your own**:  
    `https://github.com/<your_username_here>/git_exercise.git`

2. Create, stage and commit a new file.

3. Push those changes to the originating repo.
